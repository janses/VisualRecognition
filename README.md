# VisualRecognition
Uses visual recognition to determine the species/subspecies of an animal

Given a data set of Beagle, Husky, Golden Retriever, and a subset of cats, as well as a negative of any cat of prey such as a wildcat, the visual recognition can mostly deduce amongst these categories, and could likely be expanded into other categories with enough time.
